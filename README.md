# **AI Endpoint Security Tool with Generative AI (Under Development)**
🚀 *A next-gen cybersecurity tool leveraging Generative AI for proactive threat detection, real-time response, and adaptive learning.*

## **📌 Project Status: In Development**
This project is currently in the **research & development phase**. Key features are being implemented, and testing is ongoing. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome!

---

## **🔹 Overview**
Cybersecurity threats are evolving faster than traditional security solutions can handle. The **AI Endpoint Security Tool** is designed to tackle **zero-day vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, malware, and ransomware** using **Generative AI and machine learning**. Instead of waiting for known threats, our tool **simulates and predicts potential cyber-attacks** before they occur, making security proactive rather than reactive.

---

## **🔹 Key Features (In Progress)**
✅ **Generative AI-Powered Threat Simulation** – Predicts and mitigates **zero-day threats** before they emerge.  
✅ **Real-Time Anomaly Detection** – Uses **Isolation Forest** and **SVM** to monitor and detect anomalies in **endpoint activity and network traffic**.  
✅ **Automated Incident Response** – Instantly **isolates compromised systems, blocks malicious activity, and alerts administrators**.  
✅ **Self-Learning AI Model** – Evolves continuously to adapt to new threats without requiring manual updates.  
✅ **Cloud-Based Threat Intelligence (Planned)** – Keeps security updated with the latest global cyber threat intelligence.  
✅ **Cross-Layer Protection** – Covers **endpoint security, privilege management, network monitoring, and file access control**.

## **🛠️ How It Works (Planned Implementation)**
1️⃣ **Threat Simulation & Prediction:** **Generative AI** models cyber-attacks before they happen.  
2️⃣ **Anomaly Detection:** ML algorithms monitor user behavior & network activity for suspicious patterns.  
3️⃣ **Automated Response:** The system isolates infected devices, blocks malicious activity, and alerts security teams.  
4️⃣ **Continuous Learning:** The AI model updates itself automatically to stay ahead of new threats.

## **🔮 Future Enhancements**
📌 **Advanced Threat Simulation** – Improving **Generative AI models** for detecting complex cyber threats.  
📌 **Cloud-Based Deployment** – Deploying on **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**.  
📌 **User-Friendly Dashboard** – Developing a **GUI for security teams** to monitor threats visually.  
📌 **Windows & Linux Support** – Expanding endpoint security capabilities for different OS platforms.
